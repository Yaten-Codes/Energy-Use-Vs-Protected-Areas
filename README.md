**Analyzing Correlation Between Energy Using Vs Protected Areas**

This repository contains the `Energy_Use.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which analyzes the relationship between energy consumption and the extent of protected areas across various regions.

## Overview

The notebook explores how energy usage correlates with the size and distribution of protected natural areas. By examining data from multiple sources, the analysis aims to identify patterns and insights that could inform policy decisions and conservation strategies.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Gathers data on energy consumption and protected area statistics from reputable sources.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and prepares it for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizes data distributions and relationships between variables.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applies statistical methods to assess correlations and significance.
- **Visualization**: Utilizes plots and graphs to illustrate findings clearly.

## Libraries Used:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
